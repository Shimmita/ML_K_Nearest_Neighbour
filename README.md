# ML_K_Nearest_Neighbour
KNN is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm is based on the idea that similar data points tend to have similar labels and that the label of a new data point can be determined by looking at the labels of its nearest neighbors.
